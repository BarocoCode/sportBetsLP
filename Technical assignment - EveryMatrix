Write in one file of html the entire structure for the layout present in design.
Write by and apply the style according to the design.

For Desktop it has:

- one banner
- one list with one event (row)
- 3 empty areas.

As for mobile it has the same banner, the list with the event and one empty area.

The event includes:

- participants name
- score
- indicators and event information
- 3 columns of buttons (odds)
- favorite button

The first event has one OddButton selected.
The odds with green arrow have their value increased, the odds with red arrow corner have their value decreased.
If the OddButton is selected the corner arrow has a dark color.
When you mouseover the odd button it should have a different color, feel free to use any color you want;

On mobile/tablet resolution only one column of odds is displayed;

Is not a must, but it would be a plus:

- to take decision of styling responsive or adaptive content;
- to use BEM classes when writing html;
- to use SASS/SCSS to generate the CSS file;
- to use variables;
- for favorite icon to use .svg instead of .png. There are different ways to import svg icons (plain svg, icon-font...);

Advice:

- don't bother with JS, yet - only html and style is needed;
- use google fonts to import Roboto and Oswald typefaces;
- you can use the icons which were already exported;
- even if you do not know how to do something I will be interested to know if you searched for a solution on internet and based on what you made your decisions.

Compress your project in a .zip achive and send it back to us.
The project should work right after opening the .html file in browser. In case you present your project differently, please inform us of how we can check it.
